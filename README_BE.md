Laravel environment setup:

We took a laravel environment constructed by Kate and Mirko using UI as a complimentary 
component for auth/registration aspects to circumvent breezeâ€™s tailwind restrictions. 
Bootstrap was included as well. All the work was done for us, for which we are not the smarter for, but nevertheless, endlessly grateful. 

Users, roles, and permissions concept:

We ended up with a simple two option idea. The viewer can only view, and a registered user can create posts, using the @auth authentication provided by UI
