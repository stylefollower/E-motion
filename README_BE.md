Laravel environment setup:

We took a laravel environment constructed by Kate and Mirko using UI as a complimentary 
component for auth/registration aspects to circumvent breezeâ€™s tailwind restrictions. 
Bootstrap was included as well. All the work was done for us, for which we are not the smarter for, but nevertheless, endlessly grateful.
